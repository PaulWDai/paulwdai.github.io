Welcome!

I am a first-year finance PhD student at <a href='https://mitsloan.mit.edu/' style="color:#002896; text-decoration: none;">MIT Sloan School of Management</a>, where I previously worked as a Predoc fellow. I obtained my MA in Economics from the <a href='https://www.uchicago.edu/en' style="color:#002896; text-decoration: none;">University of Chicago</a> in 2022, and my BA in Economics and Literature from <a href='https://english.pku.edu.cn/' style="color:#002896; text-decoration: none;">Peking University</a>, China, in 2021. Here is my <a href='https://paulwdai.github.io/files/CV_Paul_Dai.pdf' style="color:#002896; text-decoration: none;">CV</a>.

My research lies at the intersection of finance, macroeconomics, and development. Methodologically, I leverage large-scale granular data, conduct reduced-form analysis with causal identification, and combine it with quantitative models to disentangle potential channels.

  - Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between the sectoral allocation of credit and long-run economic development. We document new Financial Kuznets Facts: as economies grow, (i) the share of manufacturing credit relative to value added falls, (ii) the share of real estate credit rises, and (iii) the reliance on and price of real estate collateral increase. A two-sector structural change model with heterogeneous collateral constraints explains these patterns through a relative loosening of financing constraints in real estate as countries develop. Governments have historically tried to address financial frictions by directing credit to "priority sectors", especially manufacturing. A new dataset reveals that the liberalization of such policies is associated with a reallocation of credit to real estate. Further, we document that manufacturing credit predicts higher long-run growth, while real estate credit predicts lower growth, consistent with theories emphasizing growth-enhancing externalities of manufacturing.  Our findings highlight the role of financial frictions and government policy in shaping credit allocation, structural change, and growth.
