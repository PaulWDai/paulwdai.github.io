Welcome!

I am a first-year finance PhD student at <a href='https://mitsloan.mit.edu/' style="color:#002896; text-decoration: none;">MIT Sloan School of Management</a>, where I previously worked as a Predoc fellow. I obtained my MA in Economics from the <a href='https://www.uchicago.edu/en' style="color:#002896; text-decoration: none;">University of Chicago</a> in 2022, and my BA in Economics and Literature from <a href='https://english.pku.edu.cn/' style="color:#002896; text-decoration: none;">Peking University</a>, China, in 2021. Here is my <a href='https://paulwdai.github.io/files/CV_Paul_Dai.pdf' style="color:#002896; text-decoration: none;">CV</a>.

My research lies at the intersection of finance, macroeconomics, and development. Methodologically, I leverage large-scale granular data, conduct reduced-form analysis with causal identification, and combine it with quantitative models to disentangle potential channels.

  - Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between the sectoral allocation of credit and long-run economic development. We document new Financial Kuznets Facts: as economies grow, (i) the share of manufacturing credit relative to value added falls, (ii) the share of real estate credit rises, and (iii) the reliance on and price of real estate collateral increase. A two-sector structural change model with heterogeneous collateral constraints explains these patterns through a relative loosening of financing constraints in real estate as countries develop. Governments have historically tried to address financial frictions by directing credit to "priority sectors", especially manufacturing. A new dataset reveals that the liberalization of such policies is associated with a reallocation of credit to real estate. Further, we document that manufacturing credit predicts higher long-run growth, while real estate credit predicts lower growth, consistent with theories emphasizing growth-enhancing externalities of manufacturing.  Our findings highlight the role of financial frictions and government policy in shaping credit allocation, structural change, and growth.

### Peers Matter: The Heterogeneous Effects of Female Peers on Scientists’ Research Focus (with <a href='https://hongyuan-xia.github.io/' style="color:#002896; text-decoration: none;">Hongyuan Xia</a>)

  - Abstract: Scientific research is less likely to focus on women, despite the importance of such studies for women’s welfare. This paper studies the impact of increasing female representation in doctoral studies on the research direction of PhD students in the same cohort. We analyze the dissertation and research trajectories of nearly all US healthcare and biology PhD recipients from 1985 to 2015. By exploiting quasi-random year-to-year fluctuations in the female ratio at the PhD program level, we identify the causal impact of female peers on the production of gender-related research, defined as research studying or relating to women, gender, and sex. We find that an increase in female students in a cohort encourages female PhD students to conduct more gender-related research, but discourages male PhD students from engaging in such research. Furthermore, the positive spillover effects on conducting gender-related research observed among female students are primarily attributed to collaborations and informal interactions with female peers. Conversely, the diminished or negative effects seen in male students appear to stem from competitive pressures. Taken together, our findings suggest peer effect is an important factor to resolve the scarcity-substance puzzle of gender-related research production.


### Childlessness and Development
  - Abstract: This paper documents the relation between childlessness (the extensive margin of fertility) and development leveraging household surveys from 78 countries over all income level. Childlessness rate displays a U-shaped relationship with development, and accounts for 1/3 of global fertility variation. Females are selected into childlessness differently across countries, mostly explained by the differences in childlessness-age profiles. I disentangle age, cohort and year effect, finding that females in richer countries delay their fertility due to career costs stem from life-cycle wage growth. A model is developed to highlight counterbalancing forces for fertility delay and motives for childlessness and to explain these empirical findings jointly.

### Life-Cycle Remittance of Rural-to-Urban Migrants

  - Abstract: Using China Household Income Survey data, I document an inverse U-shaped income and a declining remittance profile over life cycle for rural-to-urban migrants to their family members left in the rural sector. I formulate and calibrate a life-cycle model with agents heterogeneous in demographical characteristics, making migration and remittance decision, motivated by the altruism to family members. I identify a huge migration cost associated with land, a fixed benefit of living in the urban and an exogenous exit rate out of urban. My decomposition exercise indicates that evolution of household characteristics is determinant for declining remittance over ages. Policy related counterfactual analysis suggests abolishing land associated cost and exogenous exit from urban result in migration rates of 12.87% and 83.31% respectively compared with current rate of 27.51%.
